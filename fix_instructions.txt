HOW TO FIX THE INFO.PLIST DUPLICATION ERROR

This is a step-by-step guide to manually fix the "Multiple commands produce Info.plist" error:

1. Open Xcode
2. Select the AiTrading project in the Project Navigator
3. Select the AiTrading target
4. Go to the "Build Phases" tab
5. Expand the "Copy Bundle Resources" section
6. Look for "Info.plist" entry and REMOVE it (by clicking the - button)
7. Leave Info.plist in the "Compile Sources" section if it's there
8. Clean the build folder (Option + Product -> Clean Build Folder...)
9. Try building again

EXPLANATION: The issue occurs because Info.plist is being included in both the "Copy Bundle Resources" 
phase and also being processed by another build phase. It should typically only be processed 
and not copied directly.
